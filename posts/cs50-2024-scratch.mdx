A few years ago, when I embarked on my journey to become a developer, CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course was one of the first resources I turned to. Recently, to revisit the fundamentals and brush up on my CS knowledge, I decided to watch the 2024 lecture again.

This blog post is a summary of the key concepts covered in `CS50x 2024 Lecture 0`, which serves as a springboard for those who are new to computer science or want to refresh their understanding.

## What is Computer Science?

At its core, computer science is about `solving problems and creating algorithms`, which are essentially step-by-step instructions for achieving those solutions.

## Efficiency Matters

A key takeaway from the lecture is the importance of `efficiency in algorithms`. When designing an algorithm, it's crucial to consider how much time and resources (like memory) it takes to run. For instance, searching a phone book linearly, by checking each name one by one, is inefficient. A more efficient approach would be to divide the phone book in half repeatedly until you locate the desired name.

## Pseudocode: A Programmer's Secret Weapon

The lecture introduces `pseudocode, a human-readable way to represent algorithms`. It's not an actual programming language, but a tool to communicate the logic behind an algorithm before translating it into a specific coding language.

## Scratch: Building Blocks for Programmers

Scratch is a `graphical programming language` that allows users to create programs by dragging and dropping code blocks. Scratch provides a beginner-friendly platform to learn programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions, all in a visually intuitive way.
