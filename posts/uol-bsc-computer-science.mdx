## The UoL Degree Program

![Coursera Introduction](/posts/uol-bsc-computer-science/uol.png)

The University of London (UoL) offers a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science through Coursera, providing flexibility for online learners worldwide. This post explores the program’s structure, benefits, and potential challenges based on my experience.

## Program Overview

In the UK, degrees typically focus on major subjects without general education requirements, making them **three-year programs**. The UoL program follows this model but allows up to **six years to complete**, accommodating various schedules. As a full-time frontend engineer, I opted for the six-year plan, finding it perfect for balancing work and study. Unlike other distance learning programs requiring on-site exams, UoL’s program is entirely online, which suits my busy schedule.

The degree is delivered by faculty from UoL and UoL Goldsmiths and awarded by both institutions. This **global accreditation from a respected English-speaking country** was a key factor in my decision to enroll.

## Admission Criteria

```
- Age: At least 17 years old.
- Mathematical Skills: GCSE Mathematics (Grade A\*-B / 9-5) or AS Level Mathematics (A-E), or equivalent.
- English Proficiency: Specific requirements must be met.
```

If you don't meet these criteria, you can still apply via the **Performance-Based Admission (PBA) route** by passing Introduction to Programming I and Computational or Discrete Mathematics with at least 40%. This was my path due to my previous major in communication, which lacked sufficient mathematics courses.
